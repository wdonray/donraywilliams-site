  aboutMe:
    "Hello! I'm Donray, a software engineer based in Lafayette, LA.\nI enjoy working on websites, apps, and occasionally games. My goal as a developer is to expand my knowledge daily, whether itâ€™s at home or on the job.\nWhile in college at AIE, I served as a tutor during the semester and a teacher over the summer. Shortly after, I got my first job at BUH! Gaming collaborating with a small team remotely. This job as well as a few others led me to obtain a position at Stuller, the number one jewelry manufacturer in America. Here I gained a variety of skills and delved into interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.\nFollowing are a few technologies I've been working with recently:",
